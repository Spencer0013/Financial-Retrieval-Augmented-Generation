In a corporate structure, the business is a separate entity. The corporation pays corporate income tax on its profits, and the owners (shareholders) are not personally liable for the business's expenses. They are only responsible for their investment in the company. 

Additionally, in a 50/50 LLC, an individual cannot have 100% ownership if the LLC is the owner of a new business, but they can be allocated 100% of the profits and losses through a special operating agreement, provided it meets the requirement of having ""substantial economic effect"" under Treasury Regulations.",1.0,1.0,The answer accurately addresses the question by explaining how taxes work for different business entities and is fully supported by the provided context.

1. **Assess Earnings**: Determine how much the business makes in profit, such as using Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE) or EBITDA.

2. **Evaluate Growth Potential**: Project future earnings growth, for example, if the business is expected to grow at a certain rate.
